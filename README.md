# Grid-Storage-Interface
This repository contains all necessary files for the "Grid Storage Interface" course project. The primary goal is to design and size a DC/AC converter interfacing a battery storage system to a low voltage grid.

Project Overview
The project involves the following key design parameters and outputs:

Design Parameters
- Application: Storage system interface
- Rated Power (AC side): 200 kW
Low Voltage Grid: 400Vrms line-line ± 10% 50 Hz
Storage System: Battery voltage range 700-800V
DC/AC Converter: Two-level VSI
Efficiency Target: ≥ 97% at full load
Output Current THD: Max 3% at rated power
Power Factor: Unity at AC side
Cooling: Air cooled
Overload Capacity: 110% of rated load for 60 s
Ambient Temperature: 0-40°C
Design Outputs
Preliminary sizing and component stress calculations
Power switches selection and losses computation
Thermal design and validation
Capacitors and gate driver design
Sensing components selection
